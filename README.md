# HBNB Evolution: Part 1

## Description
This project implements a backend for the Holberton School HBnB application. The backend is developed using flask and containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments. Alpine Linux is used as the base image to keep the Docker image size small, and Gunicorn is configured as the application server to enhance scalability and performance.
